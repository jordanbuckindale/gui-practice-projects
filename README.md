# GTK Practice Projects

## Overview

This repository contains practice projects using the GTK+ 3 library. The primary goal is to familiarize myself with GTK and GUI development in C. The repository includes two simple GTK applications as examples:

1. **Button Disappear**: A GTK application that creates a window with a button. When the button is clicked, it disappears.
2. **Button Print Message**: A GTK application that creates a window with a button. When the button is clicked, a message is printed to the terminal. The program will exit when the window is closed.

## Notes

- Detailed comments are included in the code to explain each line and how the functions and variables operate within a GUI context.
- These projects are intended as a foundation for more complex GTK applications, such as a calculator GUI.

## Getting Started

To run these projects, ensure you have GTK+ 3 installed on your system. You can install GTK+ 3 using Homebrew on macOS:

```bash
brew install gtk+3
